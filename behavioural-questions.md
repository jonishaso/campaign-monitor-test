## Why do you want to work with Campaign Monitor?

I've heard a lot about the reputation of Campaign Monitor not only as a
successful company but also one that is truly passionate about what it does. I'm
incredibly passionate about not only improving myself professionally, but also
being in an environment where I can be of service to others, e.g. empowering
others to write better code, live better lives, etc. and as such I see myself
being able to flourish in Campaign Monitor.

## What are you really passionate about?

There are a few things that Iâ€™m incredibly passionate about, and whenever asked
I always say the same things!

- **Exploring new techniques and technologies**. This to me is not just about
  code, but more about being open and being flexible. One of my favourite quotes
  is from Steve Jobs who says to "stay hungry, stay foolish", and I think that
  that is the key to unlocking greater potential within both yourself and
  others.
- **Writing clean and concise code**. My code is not just my job, but also a way
  I express myself to others. Just like my clothes should be neat and tidy, my
  code should be the same.
- **Refactoring code to improve legibility and performance**. Thanks to the
  second law of thermodynamics, everything eventually falls into disorder -
  inculding our code :) However, as developers it is our responsibility to not
  only write code but also maintain it for the long run as needed.
- **Teaching others how to code**. I've always enjoyed introducing new
  technologies to my team and mentoring others to learn. When React Hooks came
  out in February of 2019, I ran a one-day internal seminar with two other
  developers on my team to help our whole team get on the same page with the
  technology. Whenever I have the time, I also like to write online. You can

## What is your favourite learning resource and method for learning? Why? How do you decide which things you would like to learn more about?

- I read blogs on Medium and Dev.to everyday, especially when I am on the train.
  These two mediums give me what was happening in the industry. Sometime when I
  know something new about some cutting-edge techs, I would try to use it or
  create a demo project.
- If I really want to learn a new tech quickly, I usually go to YouTube or
  Udemy. Going through a series of videos is better option than reading a book.
  Then When I have an overview, I will go to the Doc for picking out the
  specific one which I will learn more. Practicing, taking note and typing code
  with the YouTuber is vital important during watching video
- If I want to learn something in deep, I will buy a book to read.

## How do you define fulfilment and how do you pursue that on a daily basis?

As social creatures, I believe that true fulfilment for humans comes from
working well within a team. After taking on more senior roles at my present
workplace I realised that teaching and mentoring others not only brought me
fulfilment, but also brought joy and productivity to my mentees as well. Ever
since then I have always looked for opportunities to share all that I know with
others.

## What's the coolest thing you've ever created?

When I was in at university, I created a live chat app with Qt in C++. Thanks to
this app my classmates can talk with each other. To me, this is one of the
coolest things I've created, because I saw it as a huge mountain that I overcame
whilst learning some very fundamental skills and technologies along the way.
